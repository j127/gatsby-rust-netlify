# README

An experiment with Rust functions on Netlify using a Gatsby frontend. It's deployed [here](https://gatsby-rust.netlify.app/).

I used [this example](https://github.com/netlify/rust-functions-example) to get started with the Rust part and then added [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp).

Gatsby code is in the `src` dir and Rust is in the `backend` dir.

See the commands in the `package.json` and `Makefile`. Example:

```text
$ make deploy
```
